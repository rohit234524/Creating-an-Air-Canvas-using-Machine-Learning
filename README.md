# Creating-an-Air-Canvas-using-Machine-Learning
This innovative project leverages machine learning algorithms to enable users to draw and interact with a virtual canvas in mid-air, using hand gestures. Through the integration of computer vision and gesture recognition, the Air Canvas brings a new dimension to digital art and creativity.
